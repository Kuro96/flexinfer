# FlexInfer
A flexible Python front-end inference SDK.

## Features
- Flexible
  
  FlexInfer has a Python front-end, which makes it easy to build a computer vision product prototype.

- Efficient
  
  Most of time consuming part of FlexInfer is powered by C++ or CUDA, so FlexInfer is also efficient. If you are really hungry for efficiency and don't mind the trouble of C++, you can refer to [CheetahInfer](https://github.com/Media-Smart/cheetahinfer).

b. If your platform is x86 or x64, you can create a conda virtual environment and activate it.

```shell
conda create -n flexinfer python=3.6.9 -y
conda activate flexinfer
```

c. Clone the flexinfer repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Media-Smart/flexinfer
cd flexinfer
```

d. Install requirements.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
a. Generate onnx model or trt engine by using volksdep.

b. Example of deploying a classifier, you can run the following statement to classify an image.
```shell
python examples/classifier.py image_file
```
c. Example of deploying a segmentor, you can run the following statement to generate segmentation mask.
```shell
python examples/segmentor.py image_file
```
All sample files are in examples directory.
